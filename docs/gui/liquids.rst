This tool is a gui for spawning water, magma, and river sources on the map,
allowing you to click and paint liquid onto the map. It can optionally clean
existing liquids on the map from salt or being stagnant.

.. warning::

    There is **no undo support**. Be sure you know what you are doing before
    spawning any liquid, especially river sources!
